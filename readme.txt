Send an email to the administrator notifying of a change to a user profile. 

== Description ==

This plugin is to build an email and send it to the administrator
notifying them that a user has changed their profile.

A visitor to the Admin -> Dashboard -> Profile page, who changes any of the fields,
will cause an email to be generated and sent to the administrator of the site.

Such an email will be useful for those administrators running a membership 
site linked to applications such as AWeber, which only allow manual modification 
of their records.
